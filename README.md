## Security Considerations

### Token Management
- Tokens stored securely in browser localStorage
- Automatic token refresh handling
- Secure transmission over HTTPS only

### Data Privacy
- Full compliance with LinkedIn DMA requirements
- User data processed only for analytics purposes
- No data sharing with third parties
- Clear data retention policies

### API Security
- CORS properly configured
- Rate limiting implemented
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Error handling without data leakage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **DMA Token Missing**
   - Ensure DMA access is approved by LinkedIn
   - Check environment variables are set correctly
   - Verify OAuth callback URL matches exactly

2. **No Data in Analytics**
   - Check if user has recent LinkedIn activity
   - Verify DMA permissions are granted
   - Check API rate limits

3. **Authentication Failures**
   - Verify LinkedIn app configuration
   - Check redirect URIs match exactly
   - Ensure client credentials are correct

- API response details
- Data processing steps
- Cache status
- Error details
